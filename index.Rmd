## Project thoughts

Broadly, I'd like to study an internationally-focused topic. My interests are largely concentrated in two realms, which are human rights and sustainability, and I hope to study one of the two. Within human rights, I'd be interested in looking into United Nations voting patterns related to militarized conflict and their links to genocide or other human rights violations. Within sustainability, I'm interested in comparing sustainability policy across countries, perhaps related to developmental aid. I'm a bit more interested in human rights topics, but am excited to see which area I'd be able to find the most interesting data set in.
